Welcome to my 100 Days of AI journey! üöÄ

Each day, I‚Äôll log my progress, learning topics, tools explored, and small projects or code snippets I work on. This will help track my growth from beginner to AI specialist over the next 6 months.

## üæèÔ∏è WEEK 01

### ‚úÖ Day 01 ‚Äì Python Setup + GitHub Profile
**Date:** June 12, 2025  
**Topics:** Python basics, GitHub repo creation, futuristic profile setup.  
**Tools:** Git, GitHub, VS Code.  
**Notes:** Customized profile, created AI roadmap and 100DaysOfAI repos, added badges, started learning Python. 

### ‚úÖ Day 2 
Some Python syntax
Takeaway: Learning Python is like learning to think ‚Äî the
syntax is just the surface, logic is the real power. I
#AI #MachineLearning #GenAl #Python

### ‚úÖ Day 3 
Some more Python syntax, there's tooooooooo many
Takeaway: Slowly getting the logic, i am liking this!!!!!
#AI #MachineLearning #GenAl #Python

### ‚úÖ Day 4 
Some more Python syntax, ahhhhhh, when does this get over????
Takeaway: i noticed something in these past days that i am not getting bored!! and thats fantastic for a start!!!
#AI #MachineLearning #GenAl #Python

### ‚úÖ Day 5 
Revised all that i did in the past days and tomorrow I'll start with List and tuples.
Takeaway: Each part of learning python is divided into parts , a rivision is very important after every part.
#AI #MachineLearning #GenAl #Python

### ‚úÖ Day 6 
Revised all that i did in the past days , i also started maths for ML today. 
Takeaway: After learning a topic, revisit and practice it before moving ahead. It strengthens memory and understanding. 
#AI #MachineLearning #GenAl #Python

### ‚úÖ Day 7
ohh this maths is getting harder and harder!! 
Takeaway: Writing code without a compiler (on paper or in notes) boosts logic-building and reduces dependency on autocomplete. 
#AI #MachineLearning #GenAl #Python

### ‚úÖ Day 8 
huhh! i am getting a gist of it now. 
Takeaway: Apply your learning with small projects like a calculator, to-do app, or quiz ‚Äî this reinforces concepts.
#AI #MachineLearning #GenAl #Python

### ‚úÖ Day 9 
building up confidence. Takeaway: Focus on why and how Python works, not just remembering syntax. That‚Äôs what makes you a real programmer.
#AI #MachineLearning #GenAl #Python

### ‚úÖ Day 10
learned: did some changes in the RSP, added some while loops, somescope, and it was fun.  
Takeaway: practice makes one perfect. 
#AI #MachineLearning #GenAl #Python

### ‚úÖ Day 11
learned: taking some time ot to do maths also , caus thats also important.  
Takeaway: stick with the basics.
#AI #MachineLearning #GenAl #Python

### ‚úÖ Day 12
learned: finished with the basics now  planning to build a web app. 
Takeaway: Always start with something easy to build.
#AI #MachineLearning #GenAl #Python

### ‚úÖ Day 13
learned: Decided to build simple weather webapp and already strarted working on it!!!
Takeaway: nothings easy!!!!!
